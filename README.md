# Secured File Access

This project provides a secure way to access files, potentially using a graphical user interface as suggested by the image files. It appears to involve user interaction to determine correct or incorrect access attempts.

## How it Works

Based on the file names, the project likely:

1.  Presents a user interface (`mine.py` suggests a Python script, potentially using a GUI library).
2.  Handles user input related to file access (implied by `img/icons8-correct-20.png` and `img/icons8-wrong-20.png`).
3.  Secures file access (implied by `img/icons8-secured-file-24.png`).
4.  Configuration files (`.idx/dev.nix`, `.vscode/settings.json`) suggest a development environment setup and potential project settings.

Further details would require inspecting the content of the `mine.py` file.
## Modules Used

Based on the `mine.py` file, the following modules are used:

*   `tkinter`: For creating the graphical user interface.
*   `tkinter.filedialog`: For opening file dialogs to select files.
*   `tkinter.messagebox`: For displaying message boxes.
*   `cryptography.fernet`: For performing encryption and decryption.


## Technologies Used

*   Python (suggested by `mine.py`)
*   Nix (indicated by `.idx/dev.nix`)
*   VS Code (indicated by `.vscode/settings.json`)
